# Voxxmap
Base of a future Web Application based on Google Sheets to retrieve information from surveys done by Voxxmap (non-gubernamental organisation) during the 2020 covid-19 pandemic.

The application is intended to be simple: it will use Google Drive API to exchange information with a Google Forms and it stores it in a PostgreSQL database.
